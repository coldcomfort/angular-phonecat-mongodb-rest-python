# Angular-PhoneCat-MongoDB-Rest-Python

Hackathon of https://github.com/dalcib/angular-phonecat-mongodb-rest to work with Python Tornado.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to re-build https://github.com/dalcib/angular-phonecat-mongodb-rest to use Python Tornado as the RESTful server.

Basically a reworking of the AngularJs tutorial using Python for the back end.


## Note

**This is very much work in progress.**

The following are remnants from the Node.js version:

* app.js
* load.js
* server.js
